# wordle clone backend
* The Hurdle Backend Server tracks the state of the game. The backend is responsible for handling the logic that powers the game - from the selection of a random Hurdle secret word, to the verification of the validity of a submitted guess. Developed in C++.
* Developed for an OOP course @ CSUF
* I worked on the backend (developing game logic, C++).
